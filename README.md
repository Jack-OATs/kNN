# kNN

An extra credit project where I wrote a k nearest neighbor alogirthm for any dataset of integers that are able to be split into a features and classes sub-section.

# Files

## main ##
Python file that iterates through k-folds and runs it through the classifier function in knn_algo.

## knn_algo ##
File that house Outcome metrics as well as all the functions needed to determine the nearest neighbor.

## utilities ##
The amount of folds are determined here. This is also where the data set gets parsed into features and classes.
